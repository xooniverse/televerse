Televerse is a powerful, easy-to-use, and highly customizable Telegram bot framework built with Dart programming language. It provides a complete and well-structured API that enables developers to create and deploy complex Telegram bots with ease. Televerse provides a total of 0 dynamic types on its public interface, making it easy for developers to write strictly typed code.

## 🔥 Latest Update: Inline Query Result Builder

Televerse now includes the powerful `InlineQueryResultBuilder`! This feature simplifies the creation of inline query results with efficiency and simplicity in mind. Utilize methods like `InlineQueryResultBuilder.article`, `InlineQueryResultBuilder.audio`, `InlineQueryResultBuilder.contact`, and more to effortlessly generate various types of inline query results. Upgrade now and streamline your bot development process with Televerse. 

Check out [the example](https://github.com/xooniverse/TeleverseExamples/blob/main/lib/inline_queries_bot.dart) and [changelog](./CHANGELOG.md) for more details! 🚀

## 💻 Getting Started

Creating a bot with Televerse is very easy! First, you need to import the Televerse package:

## 👨🏻‍💻 Installation

Add this to your package's pubspec.yaml file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  televerse: <latest>
```

Now in your Dart code, you can import the Televerse package:

```dart
import 'package:televerse/televerse.dart';
```

After importing the package, you can create a new bot instance by providing your bot token:

```dart
Bot bot = Bot('YOUR_BOT_TOKEN');
```

Now, you can start listening for updates such as messages, commands, etc. To start polling updates from Telegram servers, simply call:

```dart
bot.start();
```

That's it! Your bot is now ready to receive updates from Telegram.

If you want to handle a specific command, such as the `/start` command, you can use the `bot.command` method. For example:

```dart
bot.command('start', (ctx) async {
  await ctx.reply('Hello, World!');
});
```

Starting from Televerse 1.3.1, you can use the `bot.start` method to start listening for updates and also set up a command listener for the `/start` command. That means you can simplify the code above like this:

```dart
bot.start((ctx) async {
  await ctx.reply('Hello, World!');
});
```

And that's all you need to get started with Televerse!

## 📚 Documentation

Televerse has a new API that is much simpler and easier to use. You can now use the `bot` instance to access the powerful Televerse methods and properties, and if you want to access the Telegram Bot API methods, you can use the `bot.api` getter. Simple, and clean.

Now, when you're inside a callback function, you can use the `Context` parameter which also provides you with the `api` property.

For example, if you want to send a message to a specific chat you can do it like this:

```dart
bot.api.sendMessage(ChatID(123456), "Hello, World!");

// or with the context

ctx.api.sendMessage(ChatID(123456), "Hello, World!");
```


## 🔊 Listening for Updates

Televerse also offers a set of custom methods to simplify your development process. Some of these methods include:

- `bot.command` to listen for commands

Let's see an example:

```dart
bot.command("hello", (ctx) async {
  await ctx.reply("Hello World 👋");
  // ...
});
```

Similarly, you have access to many listener methods including `bot.hear`, `bot.on`, `bot.callbackQuery` etc to listen to specific events.

Televerse also let's you create your own filter to cherrypick the specific update and process it.

For example, if you want to listen for messages that contain a photo with a size greater than 1MB, you can do it like this:

```dart
bot.filter((ctx) {
  return (ctx.message.photo?.last.fileSize ?? 0) > 1000000;
}, (ctx) {
  ctx.reply('Wow, that\'s a big photo!');
});
```

More listener methods listed in the features section.

## 🔑 Key Features

### 1. Strictly Typed
Televerse uses 0 dynamic types on the public interface, ensuring type safety and reliability throughout your bot development process.

### 2. 🏠 Local Bot API Server Support
Host your own Bot API server and listen to updates effortlessly with Televerse. Simply use the `Bot.local` constructor to configure your bot with a custom base URL.

```dart
/// Creates the bot instance, optionally passing the base URL of the local Bot API Server.
final Bot bot = Bot.local(
 "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN",
 baseURL: "mybotapi.com",
);
```


### 3. 🌐 Serverless Setup Compatibility
Whether you're using Cloud Functions or Lambda Functions, Televerse has you covered. Utilize `Bot.handleUpdate` to handle updates manually in your serverless environment.

```dart
// Create bot instance, and setup listeners
// ...

final json = jsonDecode(event.body);
final update = Update.fromJson(json);
bot.handleUpdate(update);
```


### 4. 🔄 Network Interceptor Support
Say goodbye to uncertainty with Televerse's `LoggerOptions`, allowing you to customize network logging options to your heart's content.

```dart
final bot = Bot(
 "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN",
 loggerOptions: LoggerOptions(
   requestBody: true,
   requestHeader: true,
   responseBody: true,
   methods: [
     APIMethod.sendMessage,
     APIMethod.sendPhoto,
   ],
 ),
);
```


### 5. ⌨️ `Keyboard` and `InlineKeyboard` Utility Classes
Easily create Keyboard Reply Markup and Inline Keyboard Markup with Televerse's intuitive utility classes. Easy as it sounds.

```dart
bot.start((ctx) async {
  final keyboard = Keyboard()
    .text("Account")
    .text("Referral")
    .row()
    .text("Settings")
    .resized();

  await ctx.reply(
    "Choose an option:",
    replyMarkup: keyboard,
  );
});
```

### 6. 🎧 Extensive Listener Methods

| `bot.onPhoto` | For listening to photo messages |
| `bot.chatType` | This method can be used to listen to messages/updates coming from a specific type of chat such as Super Group or Channel or Private Chat |
| `bot.entity` | Sets up handler method for messages that contains specified entity type |
| `bot.myChatMember` | Listens to change in Bot's chat member status - such as bot is added to a channel or kicked from a group etc. }
- And much much more :)


### 7. 🛠️ Custom Listener Methods
Wait a second, did we miss your use case? Create your own listener methods with ease using `Bot.filter`.

```dart
bot.filter((ctx) {
  return (ctx.message.photo?.last.fileSize ?? 0) > 1000000;
}, (ctx) async {
  ctx.reply('Wow, that\'s a big photo!');
});
```

### 8. 🚀 Latest Telegram Bot API Support
Stay up-to-date with the latest version of the Telegram Bot API, supported by Televerse. That's a promise.

### 9. 🛡️ Error Handling
Handle errors gracefully with `Bot.onError`, catching almost all uncaught errors from any handlers.

```dart
import 'dart:developer';

// ...

bot.onError((err) {
  log(
    "Something went wrong: $err",
    error: err.error,
    stackTrace: err.stackTrace,
  );
});
```

### 10. 💬 Conversation API
Engage users in one-on-one conversations with the Conversation API, waiting for their messages seamlessly.

```dart
// Create your bot instance
final bot = Bot(
  "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN",
);

// Create the Conversation API instance
final conv = Conversation(bot);

bot.start((ctx) async {
  await ctx.reply("Hello, I am ${ctx.me.firstName}. What should I call you?");

  // Now wait you can wait for the user's reply message. Easy, right?
  final nameCtx = await conv.waitForTextMessage(chatId: ctx.id);
  await nameCtx?.reply("Good to meet you, ${ctx.message?.text}");
});
```

### 11. 📲 `InlineMenu` and `KeyboardMenu` Utility Classes
Effortlessly build Inline Reply Markup and Keyboard Reply Markup with Televerse's utility classes, bound with handler methods for button taps.

```dart
// Define handler methods
Future<void> accountHandler(Context ctx) async {
  await ctx.replyWithPhoto(InputFile.fromFile(File("hello.png")));
  await ctx.reply("Here's your account details...");
}

// Define menu options
final menu = KeyboardMenu()
  .text("Account", accountHandler)
  .text("Referral", referralHandler)
  .text("Settings", settingsHandler)
  .resized();

// Attach menu to bot
bot.attachMenu(menu);

// Start bot
bot.start((ctx) async {
  await ctx.reply(
    "Hello, I am ${ctx.me.firstName}. Let's start.",
    replyMarkup: menu,
  );
});
```
